## Supported OTG USB modes

The base image activates the `dwc2` overlay, which allows the Pi Zero to appear as a
device (aka gadget mode). When plugged into a host computer via the OTG port, the Pi
Zero will appear as a composite ethernet and serial device. 

When a peripheral is plugged into the OTG port, the Pi Zero will act as USB host, with
somewhat reduced performace vs the `dwc_otg` driver used in other base systems like
the official `nerves_system_rpi`.

## Supported HAT WiFi devices

The base image includes drivers for the Red Bear IoT pHAT.

## Supported USB WiFi devices

The base image includes drivers and firmware for Ralink RT53xx
(`rt2800usb` driver) and RealTek RTL8712U (`r8712u` driver) devices.

We are still working out which subset of all possible WiFi dongles to
support in our images. At some point, we may have the option to support
all dongles and selectively install modules at packaging time, but until
then, these drivers and their associated firmware blobs add significantly
to Nerves release images.

If you are unsure what driver your WiFi dongle requires, run Raspbian and configure WiFi
for your device. At a shell prompt, run `lsmod` to see which drivers are loaded.
Running `dmesg` may also give a clue. When using `dmesg`, reinsert the USB
dongle to generate new log messages if you don't see them.

## Installation

Coming soon. For now, a custom system build is required until a system image file is created.
